# 10_internet_usage_clustering_202401100300030
This project explores internet usage behavior through machine learning techniques, focusing on both classification and clustering approaches. The goal is to understand user behavior based on device usage time, site categories visited, and frequency of visits.
1.Classification Analysis:
We used a Random Forest Classifier to predict user labels (e.g., A, B, C) based on their internet usage behavior.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: 92.3%
Precision: 91.1%
Recall: 90.5%
2.Confusion Matrix Heatmap: The heatmap provides a visual representation of the true vs predicted labels, showcasing how well the classifier performed.
Clustering Analysis:
The K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to segment users based on similarities in their browsing behavior.
3.Cluster Behavior Heatmap: This heatmap visualizes the characteristics of different user groups, helping identify patterns and differences in their internet usage.
We defined 3 clusters, where each cluster represents distinct behavior patterns:
Cluster 1: Users with high social media and entertainment usage.
Cluster 2: Users who frequently visit news sites.
Cluster 3: Users with balanced time across different categories (e.g., social media, news, entertainment).
4.Project Report:
A detailed Microsoft Word report was generated summarizing the classification and clustering analysis, including key metrics and visualizations.
